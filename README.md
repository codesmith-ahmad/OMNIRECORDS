## ! CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

- `get-content x.json` DOES NOT RETURN A STRING.
  This interferes with encryption and decryption, making files undecipherable.
```powershell
  $notRaw = get-content      x.json
     $raw = get-content -raw x.json
  $notRaw.gettype().name   # outputs Object[]
  $raw.gettype().name      # outputs String
```
- The `echo` alias does not work with `-foregroundcolor`. Aliases are to be avoided

## Set Up Repository First Time

Download and Install **SQLite** and **DB Browser for SQLite**

Press: `Win` + `X`, `I`

Enter the following commands:

```shell
'. "C:\OMNIRECORDS\origin.ps1"' > $profile # Redirects PowerShell to my repository
# If fail, create all required subdirectories
```
```shell
cd C:\ ; mkdir OMNIRECORDS ; cd OMNIRECORDS # Create workspace then move to it
```
```shell
git init # Initialize repository
```
```shell
git clone https://github.com/codesmith-ahmad/OMNIRECORDS.git # Clone this repo
```

Make sure to set on branch `baby` before adding and committing.

### Disable "Loading profiles took X ms" message

To disable the "Loading profiles took X ms" message, go to [C:\Users\ahmad\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json](C:/Users/ahmad/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState)
(change `ahmad` to actual username)

Add **-nologo** to `"commandline": "%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"`:
```json
    "profiles": 
    {
        "defaults": {},
        "list": 
        [
            {
                "commandline": "%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -nologo",
                "guid": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
                "hidden": false,
                "name": "Windows PowerShell"
            },
```

## SQLite CASE (if/then)

```sql
CASE
    WHEN ___ < ___ THEN a
    WHEN ___ > ___ THEN b
    ELSE c
END AS x
```

RETURNS x = a or x = b or x = c depending on first true condition

---

## SQLite View Template

```sql
CREATE VIEW _____ AS

    WITH -- This is the declaration section, put all constants and "functions", AKA Common Table Expressions here

        CTE1 AS (______),  -- subquery goes here
        CTE2 AS (______),
        ...

    SELECT -- This is the actual view section

        _____ AS Column1,
        _____ AS Column2,
        _____ AS Column3

    FROM `Table`, CTE1, CTE2, ...    
```

## Modules

Creating a PowerShell module is a great way to encapsulate and share reusable functions, cmdlets, and resources. Here's a basic example of a simple PowerShell module:

Let's create a module named "MyModule" that contains a single custom function.

1. Create a new directory for your module, typically within your PowerShell modules directory. You can find your modules directory by running the command: `$env:PSModulePath`.

```powershell
# Navigate to the modules directory
cd $env:PSModulePath
# Create a directory for your module
New-Item -Name "MyModule" -ItemType "Directory"
# Navigate into the module directory
cd "MyModule"
```

2. Inside your module directory, create a new PowerShell script module file (`.psm1`) and name it `MyModule.psm1`. This file will contain your custom functions and cmdlets.

```powershell
# Create MyModule.psm1
New-Item -Name "MyModule.psm1" -ItemType "File"
```

3. Edit the `MyModule.psm1` file with your custom function. For this example, let's create a simple function called `Get-HelloWorld`.

```powershell
# MyModule.psm1
function Get-HelloWorld {
    Write-Host "Hello, World from MyModule!"
}
```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. Create a module manifest file (`.psd1`) for your module. This manifest file provides metadata and information about your module.

```powershell
# Create MyModule.psd1
New-ModuleManifest -Path "MyModule.psd1" -RootModule "MyModule.psm1"
```

6. Open the `MyModule.psd1` file with a text editor and add module information. At a minimum, you should specify the `ModuleVersion`, `Author`, and `Description`.

```powershell
# MyModule.psd1
@{
    ModuleVersion = '1.0'
    Author = 'Your Name'
    Description = 'A simple PowerShell module.'
}
```

7. Save the file and exit the text editor.

8. You can now import your module into your PowerShell session or scripts using the `Import-Module` cmdlet:

```powershell
Import-Module MyModule
```

9. Use your custom function from the module:

```powershell
Get-HelloWorld
```

That's it! You've created a basic PowerShell module with a custom function. You can continue to expand your module by adding more functions, cmdlets, and resources to make it more useful for your specific needs.

## Changing text color

**Enter `$PSStyle` in Powershell to see all ANSI codes for Powershell styles**

#### Using ANSI Escape Code

```powershell
# Customize the prompt
function prompt {
    $grey = [char]27 + '[90m'  # ANSI escape code for grey text color
    $reset = [char]27 + '[0m'  # ANSI escape code to reset text color

    if ($PWD.Path -eq $workspace) {
        "${grey}> ${reset}"
    } elseif ($PWD.Path -like "*\NEXUS\*") {
        $nexusPart = $PWD.Path -replace ".*\\NEXUS\\?", "NEXUS\"
        "${grey}$nexusPart> ${reset}"
    } elseif ($PWD.Path -like "*\NEXUS") {
        "${grey}\NEXUS> ${reset}"
# 🌱 <-- this emoji does not work on every machine
    } else {
        "${grey}$PWD`n> ${reset}"
    }
}
```
#### Using switches

```powershell
write-host -foregroundcolor Red    # For warning
write-host -backgroundcolor Yellow # For prompt
```

## Hash Tables

These are clever and useful uses of hash tables, read:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-hashtable?view=powershell-7.3

---

## JSON Manipulation

#### APPEND TO JSON

##### Example
*.json:*
```json
{
  "key1": {
    "subkey1": "string/number/boolean/{K:V}",
    "subkey2": null
  }
}
```

```powershell
$key = "unique"                                 # Create unique key
$val = @{subkey1 = "value" ; subkey2 = "value"} # Create new object respecting existing scopes
$json = cat .json                              # Import .json file
$hash = $json | convertfrom-json -ashashtable  # Convert JSON to hash table
$hash.add($key,$val)                           # Append new object to hash table
$json = $hash | convertto-json                 # Convert hash table to JSON
$json > .json                                  # Overwrite .json
```
##### Result
```json
{
  "key1": {
    "subkey1": "string/number/boolean/{K:V}",
    "subkey2": null
  },
  "key2": {
    "subkey1": "value",
    "subkey2": "value"
  }
}
```

#### DISPLAY JSON

##### Select all

```powershell
$hash = cat ".json" | convertfrom-json -ashashtable
$psob = $hash | convertto-psob         # Convert hashtable into custom objects
$psob | format-table -autoSize         # Display as table (optional)
```
```powershell
function converto-psob($hashtable){
    return $hashTable.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { 
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            'Website' = $_.key
            'Username' = $_.Value.user
            'Password' = $_.Value.age
        }
    }
}
```

##### Select one

```powershell
$tmp = $psob | where {$_.key -eq "keyname"} # Select all in hashtable fulfilling criteria
$tmp | format-list                          # Display as list
```

#### UPDATE JSON

```powershell
$hash = cat ".json" | convertfrom-json -ashashtable
$hash.$key.$subkey = "new value"
$hash | convertto-json > .json
```

#### DELETE JSON

```powershell
$hash.remove('key1')
$hash | convertto-json > .json
```

## CRYPTOGRAPHY

##### Generate an AES key
```powershell
# GENERATING A KEY
$key = new-object byte[] 16 # Initialize a 16-byte key
$RNG = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider
$RNG.getBytes($key)         # Generate array of 16 random bytes
$key > .\.key               # Store key, key is ready
```
##### ENCRYPT (Plaintext >> SecureString >> Ciphertext)
```powershell
# ENCRYPTION
$plaintext = "secret to be encrypted"
$secureString = $plaintext | convertto-securestring -asplaintext -force
    # or user input: $secureString = read-host -assecurestring
$ciphertext = $secureString | convertfrom-securestring -key $key # ENCRYPTED SUCCESSFULLY
$ciphertext > .\.encrypted                                       # Store ciphertext
```
##### DECRYPT (Ciphertext >> SecureString >> BinaryString >> Plaintext)
```powershell
# DECRYPTION
$ciphertext = cat .\.encrypted # Retrieve ciphertext and key
$secureString = $ciphertext | convertto-securestring -key $key # DECRYPTED iff $key is correct!
$binaryString = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($secureString)
$plaintext = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringBSTR($binaryString)
```

#### Future improvement
Instead of using the key directly, use a derived key.
Derived key are obtained from a password which is more memorable.

**Learn more**:

> The key is too hard to memorize. Is there a way to generate the same key using a password?

Answer:

>Yes, you can derive an encryption key from a password using a process called "key derivation." The idea is to use a password to generate a cryptographic key that can be used for encryption and decryption. PowerShell provides a way to do this using a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) and a salt value for added security.

>Here's how you can generate an encryption key from a password in PowerShell:

1. **Choose a Strong Password:**

   Start by choosing a strong and secure password that you can remember. The strength of the password is crucial for the security of the derived key.

2. **Generate a Salt:**

   A salt is a random value that is combined with the password to create variability in the derived key. This helps protect against attacks like rainbow tables. You should generate a unique salt for each use.

   ```powershell
   $salt = New-Object byte[] 16  # 16 bytes (128 bits) salt
   $rngCsp = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider
   $rngCsp.GetBytes($salt)
   ```

3. **Derive the Key:**

   You can use the `Rfc2898DeriveBytes` class in PowerShell to derive the key from the password and salt using a PBKDF (e.g., PBKDF2). Here's an example:

   ```powershell
   $password = "YourStrongPassword"  # Replace with your password
   $iterations = 10000  # Number of iterations (adjust as needed)
   
   $keyDerivation = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes $password, $salt, $iterations
   $derivedKey = $keyDerivation.GetBytes(32)  # 32 bytes (256 bits) key
   ```

   In this example, `$iterations` represents the number of iterations used in the key derivation process. A higher number of iterations increases the computational effort required for key derivation and improves security.

4. **Use the Derived Key:**

   You can now use the derived key for encryption or decryption, such as with `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `ConvertFrom-SecureString`, as shown earlier in previous responses.

>Remember to securely store the salt value along with the derived key, as you'll need it when you want to derive the key again during decryption. Additionally, ensure that the password you choose is strong and that you follow best practices for password security.

>Key derivation from a password is a common technique for encrypting data with a user-supplied passphrase. It allows you to use something easier to remember (the passphrase) to derive a strong encryption key.

## Some ideas from old project

About frequency: when time runs out, create a copy of this task, but add frequency to deadline, reset status. As for the original, set as OVERDUE

##### CREATE

\> new-task # OR create
Title: _____     # if \$null, cancel
Deadline: ______ # if \$null, add 24 hours and set Status as "unscheduled"
	# example: aug,25,8  ==>  August 25th at 8 am
Repeatable? [Enter to skip or "n {D|M|Y}"]: _______  # if \$null, set as \$null
   1. APP
   2. FIN
   3. HOME
   4. BILL
   5. ACA
   6. CAR
   7. SPEC
Category 1-7: ______

TODO:
1. Generate new ID
2. Set title as received
3. Deadline
	3.1 Handle null case
	3.2 Parse String, call setDeadline
4. Parse frequency and return array
5. Set category as received or NONE if null
6. Save to JSON
7. Report to user

##### RETRIEVE

(On script load) Load ALL JSON into hashtable
(On script load) Convert hash to PSOB and display

> get/select <ID>  # Display info on specific task
> get/select *     # Calculates time remaining and display nicely formatted table

##### UPDATE

> update/set <ID> [-newid] [-t] [-d] [-f] [-s] [-c] [-p] [-done]
	[-newid] (replaces id)
	[-t] (change title, no compute)
	[-d] (change deadline, compute required)
	[-f] (change frequency, compute required)
	[-s] (change status, no computate)
	[-c] (change cat, no compute)
	[-p] (change priority, no usage yet)
	[-done] (set as complete)

##### DELETE

> delete/del <ID>

##### SPECIAL COMMANDS

finish <ID>  # same as update <ID> -done
